# Final_Project
Todd's Final Project for Programming Fundamentals II

Please don't use this code for your final project.  
Read it, understand it, and rewrite it how you want it.  

If you submit it without changing much, the professor will find out you plagarized with a quick google search.
Don't plagarize.  Paraphrase.
<br>
Some improvements that can be made:<br>
1. Make MAX_CUSTOMERS more flexible (dynamic array?)<br>
2. Confirmation of change prompts.<br>
3. Clear the screen properly.  Text should be aligned at top.<br>
4. Cast PreferredCustomer correctly so it doesn't need duplicate methods.<br>
5. Allow user to enter nothing to make no changes ("enter for no change") during edit prompts.<br>
6. File input/output.<br>
7. Validate input better (program crashes when stoi() fails)<br>
8. Not be so wasteful with memory.<br>
9. Security<br>
