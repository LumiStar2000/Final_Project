# Final_Project
Todd's Final Project for Programming Fundamentals II

Please don't use this code for your final project.  
Read it, understand it, and rewrite it how you want it.  

If you submit it without changing much, the professor will find out you plagarized with a quick google search.
Don't plagarize.  Paraphrase.
